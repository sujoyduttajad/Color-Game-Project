# Color-Game-Project
A JavaScript color guessing game.
This is a guessing game where you have to guess color according to the RGB() color code displayed. It has two modes EASY and HARD choose which ever you want. 
The EASY mode consists of 3 boxes to choose the color.
The HARD will have 6 boxes to choose from. 

#Vinila JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3 is used and it is responsive also.

#Future Scope
Next I am planning  to upgrade to difficult levels and add a database to show case the scores. 
Also a score-keeper app will be added with this app to monitor the progress along with authentication to track users.
