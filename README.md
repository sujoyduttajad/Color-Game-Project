# Color-Game-Project
A JavaScript color guessing game.
This is a guessing game built with JavaScript where users have to guess the correct color from a color palette which matches to the RGB() color code displayed. It has two modes EASY and HARD choose which ever you want. 
The EASY mode consists of 3 boxes so the probability is high in choosing the correct color.
The HARD will have 6 boxes and hence the probability is less in choosing the correct color.
ALL THE BEST!!!

# Future Scope
Next I am planning  to upgrade to difficult levels and add a database to show case the scores. 
Also a score-keeper app will be added with this app to monitor the progress along with authentication to track users.
